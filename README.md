<h3> Welcome to the FELTOR project!</h3>

For the CPU-Version you'll need to download [thrust]( https://github.com/thrust/thrust/tree/1.8.1) (v1.8.1)

and [cusp] (https://github.com/cusplibrary/cusplibrary/tree/0.5.0)
( v0.5.0 )

If you want to compile for a GPU you need to install [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) (minimum v5.0)

For the mpi version you need an mpi compiler. 

Feltor compiles fine with gcc-4.6

If you want to have a nice OpenGL window while computing download the [draw library]( https://github.com/mwiesenberger/draw)
which depends on OpenGL (s.a. [installation guide] (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming) and [glfw] (http://www.glfw.org) 

If you want to write to the disk install [netcdf4] (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/index.html), which is based on hdf5.
