<h3> Welcome to the FELTOR project!</h3>

For the CPU-Version you'll need to download [thrust]( https://github.com/thrust/thrust) (v1.8.1)

and [cusp] (https://github.com/cusplibrary/cusplibrary)
( v0.5.0 )

If you want to compile for a GPU you need to install CUDA (minimum v5.0)

For the mpi version you need an mpi compiler. 

Feltor compiles fine with gcc-4.6

If you want to have a nice OpenGL window while computing download the [draw library]( https://github.com/mwiesenberger/draw)
which depends on OpenGL and glfw (cf. README there)

If you want to write to the disk install netcdf4, which is based on hdf5.
