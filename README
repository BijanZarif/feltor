Welcome to the TOEFL project

REQUIREMENTS
To install the code you need to have fftw3, OpenGl and
glfw (http://www.glfw.org/download.html) installed in standard locations. 
If you experience linker problems with glfw be sure you add the correct 
 libraries for your system in the Makefile in the GLFLAGS or LIBS variable.
To install the documentation you need to have Doxygen installed

Since the code uses features of the new C++11 standard be 
sure that your compiler supports them. (minimal gcc version is 4.4)
