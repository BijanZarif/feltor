Welcome to the FELTOR project!

For the CPU-Version you'll need to download thrust (minimum v1.8)
https://github.com/thrust/thrust
and the latest cusp version (the master branch/ minimum v0.5 when it's out)
https://github.com/cusplibrary/cusplibrary

If you want to compile for a GPU you need to install CUDA (minimum v5.0).

If you want to have a nice OpenGL window while computing download the draw library
https://github.com/mwiesenberger/draw
which needs OpenGL and glfw (cf. README)

If you want to write to the disk install netcdf4, which is based on hdf5.
