Welcome to the FELTOR project!

For the CPU-Version you'll need to download thrust (v1.8.1)
https://github.com/thrust/thrust
and cusp ( v0.5.0 )
https://github.com/cusplibrary/cusplibrary

If you want to compile for a GPU you need to install CUDA (minimum v5.0).

If you want to have a nice OpenGL window while computing download the draw library
https://github.com/mwiesenberger/draw
which depends on OpenGL and glfw (cf. README there)

If you want to write to the disk install netcdf4, which is based on hdf5.
