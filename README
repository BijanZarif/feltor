Welcome to the TOEFL project!

For the CPU-Version you'll need to download thrust
https://github.com/thrust/thrust
and the latest cusp version (the master branch)
https://github.com/cusplibrary/cusplibrary

If you want to compile for a GPU you need to install the latest version of CUDA.

If you want to have a nice OpenGL window download the draw library
https://github.com/mwiesenberger/draw
which needs OpenGL and glfw (cf. README)

If you want to solely write to the disk install hdf5.
