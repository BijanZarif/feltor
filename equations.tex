\section{The Toefl Equations}

In order to use the Karniadakis scheme our equations have to be of the form 
\begin{align}
 \partial_t \vec v = \vec N(\vec v) + \vec L( \vec v)
\end{align}
where $\vec v = (n_e, n_i, n_z)$, $\vec N$ symbolizes the nonlinear part and $\vec L$ the linear part. 
The toefl equations are: (A hat above a quantity symbolizes an operator)
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    \partial_t n_e &= -\{\phi,n_e\} +\hat\kappa(\phi - n_e) + d(\phi - n_e) + g_e\partial_y\phi - \nu\Delta^2n_e \\
    \partial_t n_i &= -\{\hat\Gamma_{1i}\phi,n_i\} +\hat\kappa(\hat\Gamma_{1i}\phi +\tau_i n_i) + g_i\partial_y\hat\Gamma_{1i}\phi - \nu\Delta^2n_i \\
    \partial_t n_z &= -\{\hat\Gamma_{1z}\phi,n_z\} +\hat\kappa(\hat\Gamma_{1z}\phi +\tau_z n_z) + g_z\partial_y\hat\Gamma_{1z}\phi - \nu\Delta^2n_z
\end{align}
\label{eq:toefl_equations}
\end{subequations}
In our equations each species is specified by the dimensionless temperature $\tau_s$, the
dimensionless charge $a_s$ and the dimensionless mass $\mu_s$. Each species
has a background gradient $g_s$. Note that 
$\tau_e = a_e = -1$ and $\mu_e = 0$. $\nu$ is a artificial numerical viscosity.
The nonlinear part consists of the Arakawa brackets
\begin{align}
    N_e(\vec v) &= \{n_e,\ \phi\}\\
    N_i(\vec v) &= \{n_i,\ \hat\Gamma_{1i}\phi\}\\
    N_z(\vec v) &= \{n_z,\ \hat\Gamma_{1z}\phi\}
\end{align}
where $\phi = \phi(\vec v)$ is given by the local (linear) Poisson equation
\begin{align}
    \phi = \frac{1}{\hat\rho}(n_e -a_i\hat\Gamma_{1i}n_i -a_z\hat\Gamma_{1z}n_z) =: \hat\phi_e n_e + \hat\phi_i n_i + \hat\phi_z n_z
\end{align}
$\hat\rho$ and $\hat\Gamma_1$ are written as 
\begin{align}
    \hat\rho &= \frac{a_i\mu_i \Delta}{1-\tau_i\mu_i\Delta} + \frac{a_z\mu_z\Delta}{1-\tau_z\mu_z\Delta}\\
    \hat\Gamma_{1i} &= [1-0.5\tau_i\mu_i\Delta]^{-1}\\
    \hat\Gamma_{1z} &= [1-0.5\tau_z\mu_z\Delta]^{-1}\\
    %\hat\Gamma_{2i} &= \frac{1}{2} \tau_i \mu_i \Delta \hat\Gamma_{1i}^2\\
    %\hat\Gamma_{2z} &= \frac{1}{2} \tau_z \mu_z \Delta \hat\Gamma_{1z}^2\\
    \Delta          &= \partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2
\end{align}
which in fourier space reduce to (real) coefficients (dependent on the set of expansion functions used).
The linear part of our equations can be written in matrix form as
\begin{align}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \hat L_e ( n_e, n_i, n_z) \\
        \hat L_i ( n_e, n_i, n_z) \\
        \hat L_z ( n_e, n_i, n_z)
    \end{pmatrix} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \hat P_e\hat \phi_e - \hat\kappa -d -\nu\Delta^2 & \hat P_e\hat \phi_i &\hat P_e \hat \phi_z\\
        \hat P_i\hat \phi_e & \hat P_i \hat \phi_i + \hat\kappa \tau_i - \nu\Delta^2 & \hat P_i \hat \phi_z \\
        \hat P_z\hat \phi_e & \hat P_z \hat \phi_i & \hat P_z \hat \phi_z + \hat\kappa \tau_z - \nu\Delta^2
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        n_e \\n_i\\n_z
    \end{pmatrix}
    \label{eq:linear_part}
\end{align}
with 
\begin{align}
    \hat \kappa &= \kappa_y \partial_y \\
    \hat P_e &= \hat\kappa + d +g_e\partial_y \\
    \hat P_i &= \hat\kappa \hat\Gamma_{1i}  + g_i \partial_y \hat\Gamma_{1i}\\
    \hat P_z &= \hat\kappa \hat\Gamma_{1z} + g_z \partial_y\hat\Gamma_{1z}
\end{align}
Note that the operators $\hat P_s$ are the prefactors of $\phi$ in equation (\ref{eq:toefl_equations}).

The Karniadakis scheme now consists of the following two steps:
\begin{align}
    \vec {\hat v}^n &= \sum_{q=0}^2 \alpha_q\vec v^{n-q} + \Delta t(\sum_{q=0}^2\beta_q \vec N(\vec v^{n-q})) \ &\text{in x-space} \\
    (\gamma_0 \vec \Eins  - \Delta t \vec L) \vec v^{n+1} &= \vec {\hat v}^n  \ &\text{in k-space}
\end{align}
with coefficients
\begin{align}
    \alpha_0 &= 3 \  &&\beta_0 = 3 \nonumber \\
    \alpha_1 &= -\frac{3}{2} && \beta_1 = -3 && \gamma_0 = \frac{11}{6}\label{eq:coefficients}\\
    \alpha_2 &= \frac{1}{3} && \beta_2 = 1 \nonumber
\end{align}
That means we first have to compute the nonlinearity $\vec N(\vec v^{n})$ and add everything up to $\vec {\hat v}^n$. The second step consists of a fourier transformation of $\vec v^n_{temp}$ and the inversion 
of $(\gamma_0 - \Delta t \vec L)$ in fourier space. Note that this is a simple 
$(3\times3)$ matrix inversion as long as our base functions are eigenvectors of $\vec L$. (cf. chapter \ref{sec:fourier}) Depending on the boundary conditions we have to choose different base functions.
Note that from $n^{n+1}_e$, $n^{n+1}_i$ and $n^{n+1}_z$ in fourier space we also have to compute $\phi^{n+1}$, $\Gamma_{1i}\phi^{n+1}$ and $\Gamma_{1z}\phi^{n+1}$ for the arakawa bracket of the next step.
Also note that by choosing other values for the coefficients (\ref{eq:coefficients}) 
we can end up with an Euler or a 2nd order scheme which is important for the 
initialisation of the Karniadakis scheme.

\section{ Boundary conditions} 
The quantities $n_e$, $n_i$, $n_z$ and $\phi$ are (small) fluctuating quantities on top of
some (fixed) background gradients. Since the topology of our simulation box is periodic in the $y$-direction 
we choose periodic boundary conditions in $y$. 
Periodc boundary conditions in $x$ are sufficient as long as the gradient length scale is large 
compared to the simulation box length $l_x$.
Other boundary conditions are those where the fluctuating quantities 
$n_e$, $n_i$ and $n_z$ vanish at $z=0$ and $z=l_x$. 
When discussing boundary conditions for $\phi$, take into account that the actually measurable 
quantity is the electric field $\vec E$ respectively the $\vec E \times \vec B$ velocity $\vec v_E$.
We require $v_x $ respectively $E_y = \partial_y\phi$ to vanish at the boundary, which means that the 
boundary is impermeable for the fluid. With the gauge freedom for the potential $\phi$
we translate this into the condition $\phi( x=0,l_x, y) = 0$. Since our simulation box is
inside the plasma we require that the plasma streams freely along the boundary wall.
(Free slip boundary conditions)
This means that the gradient $\partial_x v_y = \partial_x^2 \phi$ has to vanish (no fricition). 
All in all we require
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    n_s( x=0, y,t) = n_s( x=l_x, y,t) = 0 \\
    \phi( x=0, y,t) = \phi( x=l_x, y,t) = 0\\
    \partial_x^2\phi( x=0, y,t) = \partial_x^2\phi( x=l_x, y,t) = 0\\
    n_s( x, y+l_y, t) = n_s( x, y,t) \\
    \phi( x, y+l_y, t) = \phi( x, y,t)
\end{align}
\label{eq:boundary_conditions}
\end{subequations}
\section{Fourier transformations}
\label{sec:fourier}
We know that the base functions $e^{iky}$ are eigenfunctions of every linear
operator with complex eigenvalues. That means that when we transform Equation \ref{eq:linear_part} in $y$ we simply replace $\partial_y$ by $ik$ and $\partial_y^2$ by $-k^2$. 
In the $x$-direction a sine transformation of type I or II is the method of choice 
to naturally fulfill the Dirichlet boundary conditions. Type III and IV are 
however also possible and correspond to von Neumann conditions on the right side. 
Note that sine functions $\sin(k x)$ are 
eigenfunction of $\partial_x^2$ so all operators remain diagonal.
\section{Conditions for gradients and charges}
\label{sec:conditions}
We now derive some conditions for the choice of parameters. 
We want that the background densities $n_{s0}$ produce no net charge density. This
corresponds to the condition:
\begin{align}
    \sum_s Z_s n_{s0}(x,y) = 0
\label{eq:neutrality}
\end{align}
where $Z_s$ is the charge of the s-species.
In the toefl equations (\ref{eq:toefl_equations}) all quantities are fluctuating
quantities i.e. the gradients have been separated. We assume that the 
simulation box is small enough that the background fields can be approximated by
first terms of the Taylor expansions: 
\begin{align}
    n_{s0}(x) &\approx n_{s0}(x_0) + \frac{\partial n_{s0}(x_0)}{\partial x} (x-x_0)\nonumber \\
           &= n_{s0}(x_0)( 1 + g_s(x-x_0))
\end{align}
which defines the gradients $g_s = \partial_x \ln n_{s0}$.
We thus have from condition (\ref{eq:neutrality}) and the requirement that 
every oder of the Taylor expansion must vanish seperately
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    -n_{e0} + n_{i0} + Z_zn_{z0} &= 0\\
    -n_{e0}g_e + n_{i0}g_i + Z_zn_{z0}g_z &= 0
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
(We assume that ions are always single charged.) This translates into the conditions
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    a_i + a_z &= 1\\
    a_ig_i + a_z g_z &= g_e
\end{align}
\label{eq:condition}
\end{subequations}
with $a_s = Z_s\frac{n_{s0}}{n_{e0}}$, ($a_e = -1$).


\section{ Modified Hasegawa-Wakatani Model}
\label{seq:modified}
This section follows the paper (Numata:2007). The resistive coupling term
in equations (\ref{eq:toefl_equations}) results from the parallel 
derivative of parallel electron current. However the components 
$k_z=0$ and $k_y=0$ do not contribute to the parallel current in a tokamak
and 
these components may not appear in the respective term. 
We thus modify the term $d(\phi - n_e)$ to 
\begin{align}
d(\phi - <\phi>_y - (n_e - <n_e>_y)
\end{align}
with the flux-surface average
\begin{align}
 <f>_y = \frac{1}{l_y}\int_0^{l_y}f(x,y)dy
\end{align}
Note that the averaging operator is linear and reduces to a Kronecker-delta
 $\delta_{k0}$ in fourier space. With this modification zonal flows 
 may emerge during the simulation.
 The main result of the paper is that for large gradients and 
 small coupling the saturated sate is turbulence dominated and 
 vice versa for small gradients and large coupling the saturated state 
 is dominated by zonal flows suppressing turbulence.
\section{ The limit d=0: Rayleigh-Benard convection in 2D}
\label{sec:rayleigh-benard}
Here we focus on the case $d=0$, also neglecting impurities and the hyperviscous 
terms in equations (\ref{eq:toefl_equations}) for the following discussion. 
Finally we set $\tau_i=0$, i.e. cold ions, $a_i=1$ and $g_i=g_e=g$.
If the curvature vanishes equations (\ref{eq:toefl_equations}) reduce to the Euler 
equations i.e. simple continuity equations for the densities. 

Now we consider the case of nonvanishing curvature $\kappa$:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    \partial_t n_e &= -\{\phi,n_e\} +\kappa\partial_y(\phi - n_e)  + g\partial_y\phi \\
    \partial_t n_i &= -\{\phi,n_i\} +\kappa\partial_y\phi  + g\partial_y\phi \\
    \Delta\phi &= n_e - n_i
\end{align}
\label{eq:toefl_pre_rb}
\end{subequations}
We set $n_e - n_i =: \omega$ (the vorticity) and obtain:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    \partial_t n_e &= -\{\phi,n_e\} +(\kappa+g)\partial_y\phi - \kappa\partial_y n_e \\
    \partial_t \omega &=-\{\phi, \omega\} -\kappa \partial_y n_e \\
    \Delta\phi &= \omega 
\end{align}
\label{eq:toefl_rb}
\end{subequations}
With the identification $n_e = \vartheta$, $\kappa = P$ and $\kappa+g=R$ we see that these are
the equations for the Rayleigh-Benard convection except for the term 
$-\kappa\partial_y n_e$
in the electron density equation. 
This term however does not change the onset of convection i.e. the 
typical convection cells still emerge especially in the case $\kappa \ll g$. 
After all it's a simple advective term 
i.e. advection with constant velocity $\kappa$ in y-direction. It might
however change the mode from stationary to oscillatory. (This is
supported by O E Garcia [private correspondence]. The term must be neglected
in order to arrive at the convection equations).
The essential term is the buoyancy term in the vorticity equation and the
sign of $\kappa$ determines the direction of the ``gravitational field''. 

Note that the use of periodic boundary conditions is somewhat problematic in 
the described case. When thinking in terms of convection a heat blob rises due to
buoyancy forces. With a periodic cell in the x-direction it is as if the 
temperature gradient were infinit in the x-direction. A rising blob will thus
gain an infinit amount of energy from the gravitational field (or curvature)
and accelerate without bond over time. 
This is the case especiallyi if viscosity is absent or small and will finally 
crash every simulation.
For convective problems the homogenous dirichlet boundary conditions are thus more 
appropriate.
