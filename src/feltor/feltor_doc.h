/*! @mainpage
 * Welcome to the FELTOR library. 
 *
 * @par Design principles
 *
 * The solver is built on top of the dg library which implements container free numerical algorithms, i.e. a variety of platforms can be used to run the code on including
  GPUs, single-core CPU, OpenMP shared memory and MPI distributed memory systems. 
 *
 * @par Project description
 *
 * The solver implements the solution of 3D electrostatic gyrofluid equations in 
 toroidal geometry.
