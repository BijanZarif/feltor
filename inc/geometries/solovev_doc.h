 * Welcome to the Geometry extension of FELTOR.
 *
 * This library implements generic equilibrium magnetic fields that solves
 * the Grad Shafranov equation as functors. Furthermore, it provides several derived quantities
 * like the curvature and field strength terms and a set of predefined parameters
 * that model various toroidal geometries.
 * Last but not least we add several new grids to the dG namespace.
