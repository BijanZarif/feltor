 * Welcome to the Solovev library. 
 *
 * This library implements a generic equilibrium magnetic field that solves
 * the Grad Shafranov equation. Furthermore, it provides several derived quantities
 * like the curvature and field strength terms and a set of predefined parameters
 * that model various toroidal geometries.
