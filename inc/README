Welcome to the TOEFL project v1.3 library section!

Four libraries are currently implemented. The DG library provides utilities 
for the implementation of a discontinuous Galerkin code, 
the FILE library supports
output with hdf5 and the TOEFL library is made for implementing 2D pseudospectral
codes. 

1. Library dependencies
- the DG library uses CUDA-5.0 ( and thrust which is included), cusp and to some minor extent Eigen:
        https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
        http://code.google.com/p/cusp-library/
        http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page

- the FILE library needs hdf5 in standard locations
        http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
        use -lhdf5 and -lhdf5_hl
- the TOEFL library needs fftw3 installed and relies on some features of the 
  new C++11 standard. (minimal gcc version is 4.4)
        http://www.fftw.org/

2. Library documentation
Each library comes with a documentation that can be 
created using Doxygen ( http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ ) via:
    doxygen Doxyfile 
that will create a doc/ subdirectory in the respective library.
Open with
    firefox doc/html/index.html
